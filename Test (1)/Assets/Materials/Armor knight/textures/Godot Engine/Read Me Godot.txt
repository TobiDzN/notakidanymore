create within Godot's project a folder called "Assets" and another called "Models" inside it. 
The structure should look like this "Assets / Models /"

Drag "Solus - The knight.dae" into the Models folder. Godot will import the 
"dae" file and create the material for the model.

Edit the material. In "Albedo" load the texture "knight_color.png". 
In "Normal Map" activate the checkbox and load the texture "knight_normal.png"


In "Metallic" load the texture "krita occlusion metal roughness.png" select the blue texture channel. 
In "Roughness" load the texture "krita occlusion metal roughness.png" select the green texture channel.
In "Ambient Occlusion" activate the checkbox and load the texture "krita occlusion metal roughness.png" 
select the Red texture channel.

In the inspector of Godot, look for the diskette symbol, click on it and "save" to save the material

two clicks on "Solus - The knight.dae" and choose the option "new inherited". 
This will clone your model and work on a copy. That's it, edit and save the copy as you wish.
